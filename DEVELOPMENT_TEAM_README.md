# Dev. Team README
There will be multiple branches in order to keep out repository clean and to NOT overrwrite existing data or working code.

The Master branch is the branch that will be presented on presentation day. DO NOT push to this branch unless we all have reviewed all
of the code and resolved bugs. Be sure to always know what branch are you pushing to before commiting any changes.

The Dev. branch or whatever we want to call it. Basically this is where all your INDIVIDUAL branches you have been working on will be 
merge into. I think we should considered looking at the individual branches before hand before merging and then cleaning up the code.

The Individual branches, could be named whatever you want, but most likely will be named after tasks based from out Trello when you
begin working on them. Be sure to push into this branch until you are FINISHED with the task, then it will be merged witht the Dev.
branch.
