# Echo
The github repository for Echo, the audio based game.

## Description
In this part of the project, we impelemented the functionality of a main menu, in game menu and a test gameplay that simulates how the game will be played. 
###### Main Menu
The main menu has the ability to swipe between options such as 'start' and 'settings'. Every option with the exception of the confirmation for continuing the game and all the setting options are non-clickable. Meaning they cannot be accessed during the prototype. Otherwise everything else interactable.

Usage:
You swipe left or right to change between options, tap once or click to confirmed the option you have selected. To return to a previous option, (i.e. clicked 'NewGame' and now you have to choose 'yes' or 'no' but want to go back to the game selection screen), you swipe up.

###### Test Gameplay
This is a very short gameplay of how the actualy game would be played.

Usage:
You can only swipe up to move to your end goal, also tapping once or clicking on the screen will initiate the echolocate feature that helps you navigate through the game.
