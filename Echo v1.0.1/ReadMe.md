# Echo
The github repository for Echo, the audio based game.

## Description
In this part of the project, we impelemented the functionality of a main menu, in game menu and a test gameplay that simulates how the game will be played. 
###### Main Menu
The main menu has the ability to swipe between options such as 'start' and 'settings'. Every option with the exception of the confirmation for continuing the game and all the setting options are non-clickable. Meaning they cannot be accessed during the prototype. Otherwise everything else interactable.

Usage:
You swipe left or right to change between options, tap once or click to confirmed the option you have selected. To return to a previous option, (i.e. clicked 'NewGame' and now you have to choose 'yes' or 'no' but want to go back to the game selection screen), you swipe up.

LATEST PATCHES: 
We added the functionality to swipe down in the main menu to replays the last audio clip that was played. Additionally we added the option 'instructions' in the main menu between 'start' and 'settings' that replays how to navigate the main menu and in game menu incase the player did not catch what was said during the introduction.
###### Test Gameplay
This is a very short gameplay of how the actualy game would be played.

Usage:
You can only swipe up to move to your end goal, also tapping once or clicking on the screen will initiate the echolocate feature that helps you navigate through the game.

Echolocate:
In this patch we added more functionality to echolocate, where when you tap or click on the screen you will receieve a certain amount of pinging noises to indicate how much you need to move before you hit a wall. Echolocate now can give you information on where walls are located and where an open space is located after the initial pinging. Once getting close to the end goal, it will ping the necessary amount then it will play the goal response audio that is completely different from all the audio you have heard throughout the gameplay.

LATEST PATCHES: 
You are now able to swipe left or right in the test gameplay area to change the direction you are facing, which is basically your orientation. Swiping left or right DO NOT move your 'character'. Swiping down now has the ability to open an in game menu that will be used for full release. Echolocate now has more functionality.

###### In Game Menu
Similar to the main menu you have the same methods of interaction. You can swipe left or right to change between options, tap once or click to confirmed the option you have selected. To return to a previous option you swipe up.
